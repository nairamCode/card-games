# card-games
It's an little project for learning python. Just coding/recreating some card games.

# Description
You can play blackjack with the blackjack.py (not yet) in the console. You can't card count! The cards are random each time. I really learned allot having to do with python. If something doesn't make sense the you write an Issue and I will explain it in some additional commends in the code.
